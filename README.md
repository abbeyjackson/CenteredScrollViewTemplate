# CenteredScrollViewTemplate
This is a template xib file that displays a scroll view which is horizontally centered on larger screens. It has a max width and a minimum width also. The same constraint pattern would apply if you the scrollview was shorter and you wanted it vertically centered. One of the items inside the scrollview has a 1:1 aspect ratio to demo variable constraints.
